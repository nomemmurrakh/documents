# Documents

**Typed, reactive documents on top of MMKV — fast *and* a joy to write.**

A document-oriented Kotlin Multiplatform storage library backed by
[MMKV](https://github.com/Tencent/MMKV). Define a data class, treat it as a document, and get
typed reads, copy-style updates, and `Flow` reactivity — all riding on the fastest key-value
engine on mobile.

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class GameSave(val level: Int = 1, val coins: Int = 0, val unlockedBoss: Boolean = false)

val save = Documents.document<GameSave>("slot-1")   // one call, you have a document

save.set(GameSave(level = 1, coins = 0))
save.set(MergeStrategy.UPDATE) { copy(coins = coins + 50, level = level + 1) }
save.flow().collect { hud.render(it) }   // the HUD reacts to every write
```

That's the whole story. No schema, no DAO, no `MMKV.initialize`, no serialization plumbing.

## Why this exists

MMKV is *ridiculously* fast — memory-mapped, protobuf-backed, faster than just about anything
else on the platform. But it hands you a bare cupboard: raw keys, primitives only. Want to store
a typed object? Roll your own serialization and key management. Every. Single. Time.

The pleasant alternatives — typed, reactive, ergonomic — buy that comfort by giving the speed
back. So you're stuck picking a side: **fast**, or **nice to use**.

`Documents` refuses to pick. It drops an elegant, idiomatic Kotlin API — typed documents,
property delegates, a `copy()`-style update DSL, coroutines and `Flow` — straight onto MMKV. The
abstraction costs you a little CPU for serialization and **never a single extra byte of I/O**.
Clean code on top, MMKV all the way down.

Because libraries should be elegant — so the code people write with them can be elegant too.
That's the entire point of this one. ✨

## How it feels

Open as many documents as you like with `Documents.document<T>(key)` — they all live in one
default MMKV file. Every document is quietly decomposed into **one storage key per top-level
field** (`{doc}::{field}`), so touching one field writes one key — nothing more. Values go through
[kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) into a compact internal
**CBOR** format. Zero per-type boilerplate, zero schema to babysit.

```kotlin
val save = Documents.document<GameSave>("slot-1")

save.set(GameSave(level = 5, coins = 120))   // write the whole document
val current: GameSave? = save.get()          // read it back (null if never written)

save.set(MergeStrategy.UPDATE) {             // partial update, copy-style
    copy(coins = coins + 50)                 // bumps coins, leaves level untouched
}
```

Need a separate file — a wipe-on-logout cache, per-user data, a multi-process or encrypted store?
Open a named **collection** and pull documents from it:

```kotlin
val cache = Documents.collection("cache")     // its own MMKV file
val draft = cache.document<Draft>("draft")
```

## Install

> 📦 `com.nomemmurrakh:documents` — on Maven Central.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts — a KMP module's commonMain, or an Android module
dependencies {
    implementation("com.nomemmurrakh:documents:0.1.0")
}
```

No setup ceremony: the library initializes MMKV for you, so you never touch `MMKV.initialize`.
Call `Documents.document(...)` and go.

## Quick start

```kotlin
import io.github.nomemmurrakh.documents.Documents
import io.github.nomemmurrakh.documents.MergeStrategy
import io.github.nomemmurrakh.documents.document
import kotlinx.serialization.Serializable

@Serializable
data class Player(val name: String = "", val hp: Int = 100)

@Serializable
data class GameSave(
    val level: Int = 1,
    val coins: Int = 0,
    val player: Player = Player(),   // nested @Serializable — stored as one sub-blob
)

val save = Documents.document<GameSave>("slot-1")

save.set(GameSave(level = 3, coins = 75, player = Player("Mara", hp = 80)))
save.set(MergeStrategy.UPDATE) { copy(coins = coins + 50) }

println(save.get())     // GameSave(level=3, coins=125, player=Player(name=Mara, hp=80))
save.delete()
println(save.exists())  // false
```

## The API, end to end

### Open a document

```kotlin
// On the default store — the common case. The reified overload resolves the serializer for you.
val save = Documents.document<GameSave>("slot-1") {
    dispatcher = Dispatchers.Default  // dispatcher for flow/stateFlow collection (optional)
}
// ...or pass the serializer explicitly:
val save2 = Documents.document("slot-1", GameSave.serializer())
```

### Open a collection (a separate file)

Reach for a collection only when a set of documents needs its own MMKV file — a wipe-on-logout
cache, per-user data, a multi-process store, or an encryption boundary:

```kotlin
val cache = Documents.collection("cache") {
    multiProcess = false              // share across processes (default: false)
    dispatcher = Dispatchers.Default  // dispatcher for flow/stateFlow collection
}
val draft = cache.document<Draft>("draft")

// An in-memory collection for tests — no MMKV, no persistence.
val test = Documents.inMemory()
val doc = test.document<GameSave>("slot-1")
```

A document `key` can't contain the reserved separator `::` — try it and you'll get an
`IllegalArgumentException`.

### Read & write

```kotlin
save.get(): GameSave?                       // current value, or null if absent
save.set(value)                             // replace the whole document
save.set(MergeStrategy.UPDATE) { ... }      // build over the current value (or defaults)
save.set(MergeStrategy.REPLACE) { ... }     // build over the type's defaults
save.delete()                               // remove the document and all its field keys
save.exists(): Boolean                      // true if any field key is stored
```

The builder `set(strategy) { ... }` is a `T.() -> T` — return a `copy()`, not a mutated receiver.
The whole read-modify-write runs under the document's write lock, so multi-field updates are
**atomic**.

- **`UPDATE`** → start from the persisted value (or defaults if absent), leaving untouched fields
  exactly as they were.
- **`REPLACE`** → start from the type's defaults, ignoring whatever's on disk.

### React to changes

```kotlin
save.flow(): Flow<GameSave?>                  // cold; current value, then every committed write
save.stateFlow(scope): StateFlow<GameSave?>   // hot; shared while there are subscribers
```

`flow()` hands you the current value the moment you collect, then a fresh value after each
committed write — `null` when the document is deleted or absent. Emissions are conflated and fire
only once the write is durably committed. Writing a *different* document in the same collection
won't wake this one up.

Straight into Compose:

```kotlin
val save by saveDoc.flow().collectAsStateWithLifecycle(initialValue = saveDoc.get())
```

(`save` is nullable — `null` simply means "not written yet.")

### Bind a single field

Sometimes you don't want the whole document — just one field:

```kotlin
val coinsFlow: Flow<Int> = save.fieldFlow(GameSave::coins, default = 0)

var coins: Int by save.field(GameSave::coins, default = 0)
coins += 50       // writes only the coins field's key
println(coins)    // reads only that key
```

A field delegate reads and writes exactly one decomposed key. `fieldFlow` emits the current value
(or the default if never set), then a new value each time *that* field changes — a change to a
sibling field stays quiet.

### When decoding fails

`get()` (and field reads) throw `DocumentDecodingException` if a stored field can't be decoded.
Since a document is one key per field, a single field can go bad while the rest stay healthy — so
the exception names the `documentKey`, the offending `field` when there is one, and wraps the
underlying cause. You get a clean library error instead of a bare `SerializationException`, so
your code never has to reach into the serialization layer's error types.

## Under the hood

- **Decomposition** — one MMKV entry per top-level field, keyed `{doc}::{field}`. Nested
  `@Serializable` types live as a single sub-blob under their field's key, to any depth. This is
  the trick that makes a one-field update cheap.
- **Serialization** — field values are encoded straight to bytes with an internal CBOR instance
  (`kotlinx-serialization-cbor`), no JSON text detour. It's an internal detail in v1, not a
  pluggable knob.
- **Storage SPI** — every bit of API and logic lives in `commonMain`. Only the `Storage`
  implementation is platform-specific: MMKV on Android and iOS, plus an in-memory one for tests.
- **Concurrency** — each document carries its own write lock (atomic builder updates), and
  reactive collection runs on the dispatcher you configure (`Dispatchers.Default` by default).

## Platform support

| Platform | Status | Storage engine |
| -------- | :----: | -------------- |
| Android  | ✅ | MMKV |
| iOS — `arm64` + `simulatorArm64` | ✅ | MMKV (via CocoaPods) |

One public API across the board — it all lives in `commonMain`. MMKV is bound on Apple targets
through the Kotlin CocoaPods plugin, and the library owns MMKV initialization on both platforms,
so consumers never lift a finger.

## Try the sample

A runnable Android sample lives in [`sample/`](sample/) — a tiny Compose settings screen wired to
a single `Documents` document, with buttons that flip the theme and bump a launch counter, both
persisting instantly. Clone, run, tap. 👀
