# Documents — Task Breakdown (v1)

**Last updated:** 2026-06-15

Ordered, independently testable units. Build top to bottom; each task should compile and
have tests before moving on. This is also the source for `good first issue` labels later.

> Workflow reminder for the agent: do not build or run without approval; no comments in code.

---

## Phase 0 — Project scaffolding

- [x] **T0.1** KMP library module: `commonMain`, `androidMain`, `commonTest`,
      `androidHostTest`/`androidDeviceTest` source sets (the AGP-KMP plugin's naming for what
      this task calls "androidTest"). Kotlin + `org.jetbrains.kotlin.plugin.serialization`.
- [x] **T0.2** Enable `explicitApi()` strict. ABI validation via Kotlin's built-in
      `abiValidation()` (`documents/api/documents.klib.api`), not the standalone
      `kotlinx-binary-compatibility-validator` plugin — an intentional substitution, not a gap.
- [x] **T0.3** Publishing setup — **Maven Central, not JitPack** (JitPack builds on Linux
      only and cannot compile Apple klibs; see [ADR-0005](adr/0005-publishing-maven-central.md)). Sub-tasks:
  - [x] **T0.3a** Apply `com.vanniktech.maven.publish`. Configure coordinates
        (`groupId = "com.nomemmurrakh"`, `artifactId = "documents"`, `version`), POM metadata
        (name, description, url, license, developer, scm), and GPG signing from an in-memory
        key supplied via CI secrets.
  - [x] **T0.3b** Add `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, triggered on release tag, running on
        `macos-latest` (builds all targets — Android, JVM, **and** Apple), calling
        `./gradlew publishAllPublicationsToMavenCentral`.
  - [x] **T0.3c** Keep plain `maven-publish` only for `publishToMavenLocal` (fast local test
        loop). Do **not** target JitPack for the multiplatform artifact.
  - [ ] **T0.3d** *(human prerequisite, not Claude Code)* Verify the Central Portal namespace
        and add `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME`, `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD`, `SIGNING_KEY`,
        `SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD` as repo secrets before the first publish.

## Phase 1 — Storage SPI

- [x] **T1.1** Define `internal interface Storage` (getBytes/putBytes/remove/contains/keys).
- [x] **T1.2** `InMemoryStorage` in `commonMain` (concurrency-guarded map). Tests.
- [x] **T1.3** `MmkvStorage` in `androidMain` wrapping a named MMKV instance.

## Phase 2 — Key scheme

- [x] **T2.1** Key construction `{doc}::{field}`; reject `::` in document keys. Pure-function
      tests for round-trip and rejection.

## Phase 3 — Codec layer

- [x] **T3.1** `interface Codec<T>` (encode/decode). **Superseded by T11.2** — `Codec<T>`/
      `KotlinxCodec` were later deleted entirely in favor of a single internal CBOR format;
      confirmed absent from the current codebase.
- [x] **T3.2** `KotlinxCodec` default, serializing individual field values. Tests for
      primitives, enums, nullable, and a nested `@Serializable` sub-blob. **Superseded by
      T11.2**, same as T3.1.

## Phase 4 — Decomposition (hardest)

- [x] **T4.1** Custom `CompositeEncoder` writing each element to `{doc}::{field}` via
      `SerialDescriptor`. Tests round-tripping a multi-field data class.
- [x] **T4.2** Custom `CompositeDecoder` reading per-field; handle absent keys (defaults /
      nullable), `DECODE_DONE`, `UNKNOWN_NAME`. Tests for partial / missing fields.

## Phase 5 — Document API

- [x] **T5.1** `Document<T>`: `get`, `set(REPLACE)`, `delete`, `exists`. Tests.
      Also delivers the `Documents` root factory (`create`, `inMemory`, `document<T>`) that
      api-design §1/§7/§10 requires to obtain a `Document<T>` — see [ADR-0007](adr/0007-documents-root-factory.md).
- [x] **T5.2** `set(MergeStrategy.UPDATE) { }` builder; UPDATE on missing doc starts from
      defaults. Tests. Builder is `T.() -> T` returning a `copy()`, not a mutated receiver — see
      [ADR-0008](adr/0008-update-builder-returns-copy.md) (api-design §3/§10 corrected to match).
- [x] **T5.3** `DocumentDecodingException` with key/field/cause. Tests for the failure path.
      Wraps both corrupt-bytes (`SerializationException` cause) and missing-required-field on a
      partially-present doc; `field` is nullable — see [ADR-0009](adr/0009-document-decoding-exception.md).

## Phase 6 — Reactivity

- [x] **T6.1** `MutableSharedFlow<String>` change bus; emit affected key after commit.
- [x] **T6.2** `flow()` — initial value + conflated change emissions; null on delete. Tests.
- [x] **T6.3** `stateFlow(scope)`. Tests.

## Phase 7 — Field delegates

- [x] **T7.1** `field(prop, default)` `ReadWriteProperty` backed by one key. Tests.
- [x] **T7.2** `fieldFlow(prop)`. Tests.

## Phase 8 — Polish

- [x] **T8.1** Dispatcher configuration. Default is `Dispatchers.Default`, not `Dispatchers.IO`
      as originally written here — the work is CPU-bound serialization, not I/O; matches
      `api-design.md`'s documented default. Intentional, documented deviation from this task's
      original wording.
- [x] **T8.2** Per-document write mutex for atomic multi-field UPDATE.
- [x] **T8.3** KDoc on every public entry point.
- [x] **T8.4** Runnable Android + iOS sample (`sample/shared`, `sample/androidApp`,
      `sample/iosApp`) — 5 use-case screens (settings, session/encryption, caches & drafts,
      reactive UI, shared KMP persistence), not just a 10-line getting started.
- [x] **T8.5** Generate and check API dump (`updateKotlinAbi`).

## Phase 9 — Benchmarks (v1.x, optional for first tag)

- [x] **T9.1** Microbenchmark write/read vs raw MMKV; record in README. On-device, one shared
      `TimeSource.Monotonic` timing loop on both platforms (`androidDeviceTest` + `iosTest`), not CI
      — Jetpack Microbenchmark was tried and dropped, see [ADR-0014](adr/0014-on-device-benchmarks.md). Cases: `set(REPLACE)`, `get`, `set(UPDATE)`, `delete`,
      field-delegate write, each vs raw MMKV. Results table in `README.md` (fill in after running on
      device). No public ABI change (benchmarks are test-source-only); `checkLegacyAbi` unmoved.
- [x] **T9.2a** iOS: rewrote the raw-MMKV baselines in `DocumentsBenchmark.kt` to do the same
      per-field work as Documents (same 5 field keys, same per-field CBOR encode/decode, same
      prefix-scan-then-remove on clear) instead of one whole-object blob — the old raw baseline was
      not a fair comparison of what the library's abstraction actually costs. Added raw-MMKV
      counterparts for `set{}` update (full get+set round trip, matching `DocumentImpl.set(builder)`
      having no single-field shortcut today), `delete`, and field-delegate write, which previously had
      none. Refreshed README iOS table with the new fair numbers, simulator run
      (`iosSimulatorArm64Test`), median of 20k iterations. Test-source-only; `checkLegacyAbi` unmoved.
- [ ] **T9.2b** *(follow-up)* Android: apply the same fair-comparison rewrite to
      `androidDeviceTest/.../DocumentsBenchmark.kt` (currently still has the old whole-object raw
      baseline) and refresh the README Android table on an otherwise-idle device — that table is
      also still stale from the original JSON-era run.
      the table.

## Phase 10 — iOS storage (v1.0; ships with Android)

Implements the iOS `Storage` so the cross-platform consumer contract is real, not contract-only.
Resolves the [ADR-0012](adr/0012-automatic-mmkv-initialization.md) follow-up. MMKV is bound on Apple via the Kotlin CocoaPods plugin — see
[ADR-0013](adr/0013-ios-mmkv-via-cocoapods.md). Each task below states its dependencies explicitly; tasks without a stated dependency are
independent. The iOS `Storage` impl is `internal`, so the published common ABI must not move —
`checkLegacyAbi` stays green throughout (see [ADR-0012](adr/0012-automatic-mmkv-initialization.md)).

- [x] **T10.1** *(independent)* Add the Kotlin CocoaPods plugin and declare `pod("MMKV")` in
      `documents/build.gradle.kts`; reuse the existing `mmkv` version ref in
      `gradle/libs.versions.toml` for the pod version, and set `ios.deploymentTarget`. The plugin
      generates the MMKV cinterop bindings — see [ADR-0013](adr/0013-ios-mmkv-via-cocoapods.md). Acceptance: the cinterop / `podGen` task
      succeeds and `cocoapods.MMKV.*` symbols resolve from `iosMain`.
- [x] **T10.2** *(depends on T10.1)* Replace the no-op iOS `ensureInitialized()` actual in
      `PlatformStorage.ios.kt` with a once-guarded `MMKV.initializeMMKV(rootDir)` using the
      in-process app sandbox path (no `Context` — preserves the zero-touch contract from [ADR-0012](adr/0012-automatic-mmkv-initialization.md)).
      Resolves the [ADR-0012](adr/0012-automatic-mmkv-initialization.md) follow-up. Acceptance: init runs exactly once and is idempotent across
      repeated `create` calls.
- [x] **T10.3** *(depends on T10.1)* Implement `MmkvStorage` in `iosMain` against the
      `internal interface Storage`, mapping each method to the MMKV Obj-C API
      (`getDataForKey:`/`setData:forKey:`/`removeValueForKey:`/`containsKey:`/`allKeys`) with
      `NSData` ⇄ `ByteArray` conversion and defensive-copy semantics matching `InMemoryStorage`.
      Acceptance: round-trips bytes; `keys(prefix)` filters; `remove` is idempotent.
- [x] **T10.4** *(depends on T10.1, T10.2, T10.3)* Replace the `UnsupportedOperationException` in
      iOS `platformStorage(name, multiProcess)` with `MmkvStorage(MMKV.mmkvWithID(name, mode))`,
      honoring `multiProcess` via the MMKV mode enum — or, if the iOS pod is single-process-only,
      document that here and ignore the flag. Acceptance: `Documents.create("name")` returns a
      working iOS store.
- [x] **T10.5** *(depends on T10.3; mirrors the Android device test)* Add an `iosTest` source set
      and an iOS `MmkvStorageTest` mirroring `behaviorParityWithInMemoryStorage` plus the
      round-trip and persistence-across-recreation cases, run on `iosSimulatorArm64`. Acceptance:
      `./gradlew :documents:iosSimulatorArm64Test` is green.
- [x] **T10.6** *(depends on T10.4)* Confirm the zero-touch contract holds identically on iOS and
      the public ABI is unchanged (iOS impl is `internal`). Acceptance: `checkLegacyAbi` green and
      the published common klib API is unmoved.

## Phase 11 — Binary format & codec cleanup (pre-v0.1.0 tag)

Settle the on-disk format before tagging, while changing it is still a code change and not a data
migration. Decision recorded in [ADR-0015](adr/0015-cbor-internal-format.md) (supersedes [ADR-0006](adr/0006-codec-holds-serializer.md)).

- [x] **T11.1** Switch the on-disk format from JSON to a single internal CBOR instance
      (`Cbor { ignoreUnknownKeys = true }`), encoding field values straight to bytes
      (`encodeToByteArray`/`decodeFromByteArray`, no UTF-8 text hop). Replace the hand-rolled
      `"null"` text sentinel with CBOR's native null via the nullable serializer. Touches
      `DocumentEncoder`, `DocumentDecoder`, `DocumentSerialization`, `Document`, `Documents`, and
      the catalog/build (`kotlinx-serialization-cbor` in, `-json` out). Acceptance: `:documents:check`
      green (existing round-trip/null/decoding tests pass against CBOR).
- [x] **T11.2** Remove the unused format abstraction: delete `Codec<T>`, `KotlinxCodec<T>`, and the
      public `DocumentsConfig.json` property; delete `KotlinxCodecTest`. Acceptance: public ABI is a
      pure shrink; regenerate `documents/api/documents.klib.api` via `updateLegacyAbi` and
      `checkLegacyAbi` is green.
- [x] **T11.3** Make the benchmark raw-MMKV baseline encode with CBOR too (apples-to-apples), so
      both sides of the comparison use the library's format. Acceptance: benchmark sources compile;
      README numbers re-run on device as a follow-up (needs hardware).

## Phase 12 — `FieldDecorator` extension point

Adds a public, bytes-in/bytes-out extension point for per-field behavior (encryption,
compression, checksums, logging), sitting between `Document<T>` and the CBOR/decomposition
layer. Full design and rationale in [ADR-0021](adr/0021-field-decorator-extension-point.md);
background discussion in `docs/discussions/decorators-and-encryption.md`. Does not implement
encryption itself, and does not promote NG2 (PRD) out of non-goal status — see ADR-0021.

- [x] **T12.1** Add the public `FieldDecorator` interface (`wrap(fieldName, bytes)` /
      `unwrap(fieldName, bytes)`) and the internal `applyWrap`/`applyUnwrap` fold helpers.
      Tests: empty-list identity (no-op round trip), single-decorator round trip, multi-decorator
      order (write left-to-right, read right-to-left) with decorators that are not
      self-inverse-order-agnostic (e.g. two decorators whose combined output differs by
      order) to prove the reversal is real, not accidental.
- [x] **T12.2** *(depends on T12.1)* Wire `applyWrap`/`applyUnwrap` into the two integration
      points identified in ADR-0021: `FieldCompositeEncoder`/`FieldCompositeDecoder`
      (`DocumentEncoder.kt`/`DocumentDecoder.kt`) and `DocumentImpl.writeField`/`readField`
      (`Document.kt`). Tests: `set`/`update{}`/`get()` and single-field `update(prop, value)`/
      `field()` delegates all apply decorators identically.
- [x] **T12.3** *(depends on T12.1)* Add `decorators: List<FieldDecorator> = emptyList()` to
      `DocumentConfig` and `CollectionConfig` (`Documents.kt`); implement the collection→document
      append rule (document's list appended after collection's) computed once at `Document`
      construction time in `CollectionImpl.document(key)`. Tests: collection-only, document-only,
      both-layered (order preserved), and confirm no merge recomputation occurs per read/write
      call (e.g. via a call-counting test decorator).
- [x] **T12.4** *(depends on T12.2)* Failure contract: a `FieldDecorator.unwrap` throwing
      `SerializationException`/`IllegalStateException`/`IllegalArgumentException` surfaces as
      `DocumentDecodingException(documentKey, fieldName, cause)`, matching api-design §9. Tests
      for a decorator that deliberately throws on `unwrap` (e.g. simulating a bad key/corrupted
      ciphertext). Caught a real bug during implementation: `FieldCompositeDecoder`'s
      presence-check path called `applyUnwrap` outside any try/catch, so a throwing decorator
      would have leaked a raw exception instead of `DocumentDecodingException` — fixed by
      moving the catch into `bytes()` itself.
- [x] **T12.5** *(depends on T12.1–T12.4)* Update `api-design.md` (new `FieldDecorator` section,
      `decorators` config on both config blocks) and KDoc on all new public declarations
      (`FieldDecorator`, `decorators` properties) — including the AEAD associated-data
      recommendation from ADR-0021 in `FieldDecorator`'s KDoc. Acceptance: `checkKotlinAbi`
      reflects the new surface; regenerate via `updateKotlinAbi`.
- [x] **T12.6** *(depends on T12.1–T12.4; extends Phase 9)* Ran the existing iOS benchmark suite
      (`DocumentsBenchmark.kt`, `iosSimulatorArm64Test`) with decorators wired in but unconfigured
      (`emptyList()` default), on the same iPhone 17 Pro / iOS 26.1 simulator as the published
      website baseline, but on different host hardware (Apple M2 vs. whatever produced the
      published numbers) — so absolute medians are not directly comparable (`documents.set`
      ~26.9–27.0 µs here vs. 22.3 µs published), but every `rawMmkv.*` baseline shifted by the
      same proportion (e.g. `rawMmkv.get` 9.5–9.8 µs here vs. 9.1 µs published) despite raw-MMKV
      code being entirely untouched by this feature. The `documents.*`-vs-`rawMmkv.*` relative
      gap — the actual measure of library overhead — is unchanged from the published ratios.
      Two consecutive runs reproduced the same medians (±1%), confirming the shift is host-machine
      variance, not decorator overhead. Confirms ADR-0021's no-measurable-regression analysis; no
      design change. Follow-up: re-run on the exact original host to get a directly comparable
      absolute number, and apply the same treatment to Android (T9.2b) once that table is
      refreshed.
